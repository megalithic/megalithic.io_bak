From the beginning, for this site, I knew I wanted to use the tech stack I presently
use at work. That, thankfully, involves fun langs, such as [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
and [elm](https://elm-lang.org). I also wanted to avoid off-the-shelf solutions
for a blogging engine, deployment strategies, etc.
